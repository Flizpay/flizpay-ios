## 📦 Requirements

The FLIZpay iOS SDK requires Xcode 15 or later and is compatible with apps targeting iOS 13 or above. 

## ⚡️ Quick Start

After installing the SDK, initiate payments effortlessly by: 
- authorizing your transaction with the `API_KEY` in your backend to obtain a token
- use it to load the FLIZPay environment in your application

```swift
import FlizpaySDK

FlizpaySDK.initiatePayment(
    from: currentViewController,
    token: token,
    amount: userAmount
) { error in
    // Handle any error returned from the SDK.
    print("Payment failed: \(error)")
}
```

### Parameters

- **`from`** (`UIViewController`, required): The Presenting View Controller where the webview is going to be attached
- **`token`** (`String`, required): JWT authentication token obtained from your backend (Check our docs on how to authenticate).
- **`amount`** (`String`, required): The payment amount.
- **`@closure onFailure `** (`Function`, optional): Block that receives an error param to be called when the webview can't be opened
